# Cyber-systems-curriculum
The curriculum for the Cyber Systems major is based on the Coast Guard’s commitment to develop a workforce capable of meeting the most complex technical challenges in the cyber domain.

In the Coast Guard, cyber is a multidisciplinary, operational pursuit. The curriculum therefore delivers a strong technical cyber computing foundation. It is enriched beyond the Academy’s broad core curriculum, in engineering, management, mathematics, and the humanities – taught through a cyber systems lens.
